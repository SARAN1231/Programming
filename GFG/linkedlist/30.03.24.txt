Given an unsorted linked list of N nodes. The task is to remove duplicate elements from this unsorted Linked List. When a value appears in multiple nodes, the node which appeared first should be kept, all others duplicates are to be removed.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 4
value[] = {5,2,2,4}
Output: 5 2 4
Explanation:Given linked list elements are
5->2->2->4, in which 2 is repeated only.
So, we will delete the extra repeated
elements 2 from the linked list and the
resultant linked list will contain 5->2->4

class Solution
{
    public:
    //Function to remove duplicates from unsorted linked list.
    Node * removeDuplicates( Node *head) 
    {
     // your code goes here
     struct Node *temp1,*temp2,*prev;
     temp2 = temp1 = head;
     while(temp1 != NULL) {
     while(temp2 != NULL){
     if (temp1->data == temp2->data && temp1 != temp2) {
        struct Node *temp = temp2;
        if (prev != nullptr) {
        prev->next = temp2->next;
        } 
        else {
        head = temp2->next; // If prev is nullptr, temp2 is the head, so update head
        }
        free(temp);
    } 
    else {
         prev = temp2;
    }
temp2 = temp2->next;
     }
     temp2 = head;
     temp1 = temp1->next;
     }
     return head;
    }
};


You are given a node del_node of a Singly Linked List where you have to delete a value of the given node from the linked list but you are not given the head of the list.

By deleting the node value, we do not mean removing it from memory. We mean:

The value of the given node should not exist in the linked list.
The number of nodes in the linked list should decrease by one.
All the values before & after the del_node node should be in the same order.
Note:

Multiple nodes can have the same values as the del_node, but you must only remove the node whose pointer del_node is given to you.
It is guaranteed that there exists a node with a value equal to the del_node value and it will not be the last node of the linked list.
Example 1:

Input:
Linked List = 1 -> 2
del_node = 1
Output: 
2
Explanation: 
After deleting 1 from the linked list, 
we have remaining nodes as 2.
class Solution
{
    public:
    //Function to delete a node without any reference to head pointer.
    void deleteNode(Node *del_node)
    {
       // Your code here
       
       struct Node *next_node = del_node->next; 
       if(del_node == NULL || next_node == NULL)
       return ;
       del_node->data = next_node->data;
       del_node->next = next_node->next;
       free(next_node);
    }
